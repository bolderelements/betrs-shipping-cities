Narrow down your WooCommerce shipping zones based on city names

== Description ==

The shipping zones introduced in WooCommerce 2.6 were a great addition for many international shops, however not all countries have a postal code system. This makes it difficult to offer special rates for certain cities. This plugin aims to ease the trouble by offering a second option: Limit to specific cities.
